Spark (previously yarn) is a passion project by Benyamin Damircheli. 

It's built with Electron.js, React, TypeScript/JavaScript and Ollama's API.

I wanted a journaling app that was built for thinking in bursts, not in long winded paragraphs. But I also wanted to see how I could use AI to help me gain deeper insights into my thoughts and feelings as I've seen others use commercially available models to do so (ex. [https://x.com/danshipper/status/1748725150260818026](https://x.com/danshipper/status/1748725150260818026)).

Spark is an AI enabled journaling app that allows users to "speak" to their journal and gain deeper insights into their thoughts and feelings. It's perfect for people who like to think in bursts and want to come back and add onto them later.

## Features

### 1. Write posts, reply to them with either your own thoughts or AI guided reflections.

## Important note on using the AI features
If you want to use the AI features, you'll need to download Ollama and run it locally. You can download it [here](https://ollama.com/download) for free.
Then make sure to download and pull "llama3.1:8b" and "mxbai-embed-large" models. If you're not sure how to do this, you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main).

## Final thoughts
I've spent a lot of time building this app and I'm proud of what I've built. It's not perfect yet, but I learnt a lot and had a lot of fun making it. I'll be using it and improving it over time, if you download it and find any bugs or have any suggestions please let me know!
