Spark (previously yarn) is a passion project by Benyamin Damircheli. 

I wanted a journaling app that was built for thinking in bursts, not in long winded paragraphs. But I also wanted to see how I could use AI to help me gain deeper insights into my thoughts and feelings as I've seen others use commercially available models to do so (ex.

Spark is an AI enabled journaling app that allows users to "speak" to their journal and gain deeper insights into their thoughts and feelings. It's perfect for people who like to think in bursts and want to come back and add onto them later.
